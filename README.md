# Economics-Case-Competition-2025
CASE competition jointly organised by NUS, NTU, SIM and SMU

## Background
Labor productivity is a critical driver of Singapore's economic growth, particularly as the nation targets an average annual growth of 2–3% over the next decade, with 1–2 percentage points driven by productivity improvements. However, structural changes in the economy, including digitalisation, Industry 4.0, and a rapidly evolving job market, have presented challenges that hinder productivity growth.

## Problem Statement Chosen
Develop strategies to bridge the skills gap in Singapore’s workforce, aligning competencies with high-growth sectors like digital services and green industries.
